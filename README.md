# Graphs-

Using the adjacency matrix implementation, extend the class GraphType (C++) to include
a Boolean EdgeExists operation, which determines whether two vertices are connected by an edge
a DeleteEdge operation, which deletes a given edge.
Create main to test EdgeExists and DeleteEdge operations. 
Link to partially implemented GrathType: Graph.zip. Read Read Me.txt file first. This particular implementation of weighted graph uses templates. If you are not familiar with templates in C++, go to
